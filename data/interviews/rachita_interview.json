      "content": "yeah Lego specific example would be getting a lot of pimples or acne on my face if I have a lot of heat in my body the specifically happens when I drink a lot of tea and a specific kind of tea even so I'm noticed that which leads directly to my lifestyle I don't think a lot about aging and skin changes but the only time I think about it is when I need to make sure that I'm healthier on the inside and I do and partake in healthy activities which is like a mix of cardio as well as weight training apart from that I don't really think about aging as much I think I've always found a balance between skincare and wellness I think I got to Wellness before skincare skincare is more of a recent in involvement in My overall wellness and in terms of watch with shaped my current philosophy it's more so that as you grow older you sort of need to have a good sense of like what to eat or put in your body or to put in your face and look presentable and well put together at all times",
